      <h2>Welcome to Number Guess Game</h2>
      <h3>Instructions :</h3>
      <p>The game is two-person game called <span>"Guess the Number"</span>. The first player thinks of an integer
        within a
        known range. The
        second player tries to guess the number. If the guess is incorrect, then the first player tells the second
        player
        whether the guess was too high or too low. The program simulates first player. </p>
      <h3>Tips :</h3>
      <p>The key strategy in this game is to generate a clever guess. If, for example, the second player knows the
        number
        is
        between 0 and 100, then a reasonable first guess is 50. This choice evenly splits the range, giving you the
        maximum
        amount of information about the next guess. If the first player says the guess is too low, then the second
        player
        splits
        the reduced range and guesses 75. If the player says the guess is too high, then the optimal guess is 25.</p>
